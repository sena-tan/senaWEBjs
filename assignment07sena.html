    <h4>3 questions for this assignment:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Make an Array of strings and assign it to a variable. You may make the strings a list of anything you like
            and
            use a variable name of your choice.</li>
        <li>
            Use one of the methods of the Array object to insert a new element to the beginning of your array.
        </li>
        <li>
            Using the Array you made in the previous steps, iterate over its elements and write each one to the console.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <script>
        var colors = ["red", "green", "blue", "white", "black"];
        colors.unshift("yellow")
        var len = colors.length;
        var text = "";
        for (var i = 0; i < len; i++) {
            text += colors[i] + "\n";
        }
        // console.log(colors)
        console.log(text)
    </script>
